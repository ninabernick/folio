[WIP] Platform for Hosting Artist Portfolios

A platform for artists to showcase their portfolios for personal or academic use. Backend is a Django API and frontend is ReactJS. This is a work in progress and aims to support the following features:

* customization of appearance and color scheme of portfolio page
* galleries separating works of different mediums
* collaborative galleries with multiple artists
* browsing other artists using similarity detection algorithms to find similar-styled works

This is largely a personal project for me to learn Django and improve my Python and React skills.
